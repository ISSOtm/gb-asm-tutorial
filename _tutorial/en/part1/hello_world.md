title: Hello World!
---

In this lesson, we will begin by assembling our first program.
The rest of this chapter will be dedicated to explaining how and why it works.

Note that we will need to type a lot of commands, so open a terminal now.
It's a good idea to create a new directory (`mkdir gb_hello_world`, for example, then `cd gb_hello_world` to enter the new directory).

Grab the following files (right-click each link, "Save Link As..."), and place them all in this new directory:
- [`hello-world.asm`]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/hello-world.asm %})
- [`hardware.inc`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbdev/hardware.inc/v4.0/hardware.inc)

Then, still from a terminal within that directory, run the following three commands.
⚠️ For clarity, a `$` has been added at the beginning of each command, but don't copy-paste them!
{% highlight console %}
$ rgbasm -o hello-world.o hello-world.asm
$ rgblink -o hello-world.gb hello-world.o
$ rgbfix -v -p 0xFF hello-world.gb
{% endhighlight %}

It should look like this:
<script id="asciicast-xfWYirngXORWF2t2jPGWz9nXB" src="https://asciinema.celforyon.fr/a/xfWYirngXORWF2t2jPGWz9nXB.js" async></script>

(If you encounter an error you can't figure out by yourself, don't be afraid to [ask us]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/index.md %}#feedback)! We'll sort it out.)

Congrats!
You just assembled your first Game Boy ROM!
Now, we just need to run it; open BGB, right-click the window that opened, and load `hello-world.gb`.

<video controls poster="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/vid/hello_world.poster.png %}">
	<source src="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/vid/hello_world.webm %}" type="video/webm">
	<source src="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/vid/hello_world.mp4 %}" type="video/mp4">

	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/vid/hello_world.gif %}" alt="Video demonstration in BGB">
</video>

You could also take a flash cart (I use the [EverDrive GB X5](https://krikzz.com/store/home/47-everdrive-gb.html), but there are plenty of alternatives), load up your ROM onto it, and run it on an actual console!

Well, now that we have something working, it's time to peel back the curtains...
