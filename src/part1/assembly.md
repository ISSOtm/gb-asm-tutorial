# Assembly basics

Alright, now that we know what the tools *do*, let's see what language RGBASM speaks.
I will take a short slice of the beginning of `hello-world.asm`, so that we agree on line numbers and you can get some syntax highlighting even if your editor doesn't support it.

```rgbasm,linenos
{{#include ../assets/hello-world.asm:basics}}
```

Let's analyze it.
Note that I will be ignoring a *lot* of RGBASM's functionality; if you're curious to know more, you should wait until parts II and III, or [read the docs](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs).

## Comments

We'll start with line {{#line_no_of "^\s*;" ../assets/hello-world.asm:basics}}, which should appear gray above.
Semicolons `;` denote *comments*.
Everything from a semicolon to the end of the line is *ignored* by RGBASM.
As you can see on line {{#line_no_of "^.*\s.*;" ../assets/hello-world.asm:basics}}, comments need not be on an otherwise empty line.

Comments are a staple of every good programming language; they are useful to give context as to what code is doing.
They're the difference between "Pre-heat the oven at 180 ¬∞C" and "Pre-heat the oven at 180 ¬∞C, any higher and the cake would burn", basically.
In any language, good comments are very useful; in assembly, they play an even more important role, as many common semantic facilities are not available.

## Instructions

Assembly is a very line-based language.
Each line can contain a *directive*, which instructs RGBASM to do something, or an *instruction*[^instr_directive], which is copied directly into the ROM.
We will talk about directives later, for now let's focus on instructions: for example, in the snippet above, we will ignore lines {{#line_no_of "^\s*INCLUDE" ../assets/hello-world.asm:basics}} (`INCLUDE`), {{#line_no_of "^\s*ds" ../assets/hello-world.asm:basics}} (`ds`), and {{#line_no_of "^\s*SECTION" ../assets/hello-world.asm:basics}} (`SECTION`).

To continue the cake-baking analogy even further, instructions are like steps in a recipe.
The console's processor (<abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>) executes instructions one at a time, and that... eventually does something!
Like baking a cake, drawing a "Hello World" image, or displaying a Game Boy programming tutorial!
\*wink\* \*wink\*

Instructions have a *mnemonic*, which is a name they are given, and *operands*, which indicate what they should act upon.
For example, in "melt the chocolate and butter in a saucepan", *the whole sentence* would be the instruction, *the verb* "melt" would be the mnemonic, and "chocolate", "butter", and "saucepan" the operands, i.e. some kind of parameters to the operation.

Let's discuss the most fundamental instruction, **`ld`**.
`ld` stands for "LoaD", and its purpose is simply to copy data from its right operand (["<abbr title="Right-Hand Side">RHS</abbr>"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sides_of_an_equation)) into its left operand (["<abbr title="Left-Hand Side">LHS</abbr>"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sides_of_an_equation)).
For example, take line {{#line_no_of "^\s*ld a, 0" ../assets/hello-world.asm:basics}}'s `ld a, 0`: it copies ("loads") the value 0 into the 8-bit register `a`[^ld_imm_from].
If you look further in the file, line {{#line_no_of "^\s*ld a, b" ../assets/hello-world.asm}} has `ld a, b`, which causes the value in register `b` to be copied into register `a`.

Instruction | Mnemonic | Effect
------------|----------|----------------------------------------
Load        | `ld`     | Copies values around

Due to CPU limitations, not all operand combinations are valid for `ld` and many other instructions; we will talk about this when writing our own code later.

RGBDS has an [instruction reference](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/v0.5.1/gbz80.7) worth bookmarking, and you can also consult it locally with `man 7 gbz80` if RGBDS is installed on your machine (except Windows...).
The descriptions there are more succinct, since they're intended as reminders, not as tutorials.

[^instr_directive]:
Technically, instructions in RGBASM are implemented as directives, basically writing their encoded form to the ROM; but the distinction between the instructions in the source code and those in the final ROM is not worth bringing up right now.

[^ld_imm_from]:
The curious reader may ask where the value is copied *from*. The answer is simply that the \"immediate\" byte ($00 in this example) is stored in ROM just after the instruction's opcode byte, and it's what gets copied to `a`.
We will come back to this when we talk about how instructions are encoded later on.
