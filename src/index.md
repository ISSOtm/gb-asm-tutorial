üëã Welcome to gb-asm-tutorial!
This tutorial will teach you how to make games for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color.

::: warning:‚ö†Ô∏è

While the Game Boy and Game Boy Color are almost the same console, **the Game Boy Advance is entirely different**.
However, the GBA is able to run GB and GBC games!
If you are looking to program GBC games and run them on a GBA, you're at the right place; however, if you want to make games specifically for the GBA, please check out [Tonc](http://coranac.com/tonc/text) instead.

## Controls

There are some handy icons near the top of your screen!

- The "burger" <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> toggles the navigation side panel;
- The brush <i class="fa fa-paint-brush"></i> allows selecting a different color theme;
- The magnifying glass <i class="fa fa-search"></i> pops up a search bar;
- The printer <i class="fa fa-print"></i> gives a single-page version of the *entire* tutorial, which you can print if you want;
- The GitHub icon <i class="fa fa-github"></i> links to the tutorial's source repository;
- The edit button <i class="fa fa-edit"></i> allows you to suggest changes to the tutorial, provided that you have a GitHub account.

Additionally, there are arrows to the left and to the right of the page (they are at the bottom instead on mobile) to more easily navigate to the next page.

With that said, you can get started by simply navigating the the following page :)
