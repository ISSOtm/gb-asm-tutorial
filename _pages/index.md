Welcome to gb-asm-tutorial!
This tutorial will teach you how to make games for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color.

⚠️ While the Game Boy and Game Boy Color are almost the same console, **the Game Boy Advance is entirely different**.
However, the GBA is able to run GB and GBC games!
If you are looking to program GBC games and run them on a GBA, you're at the right place; however, if you want to make games specifically for the GBA, please check out [Tonc](http://coranac.com/tonc/text) instead.

## Roadmap

The tutorial is split into three sections.
**I strongly advise you go through the tutorial in order!**

In Part I, we run our first "Hello World!" program, which we then dissect to learn what makes the Game Boy tick.

In Part II, we program our first game, a clone of *Arkanoid*; we learn how to prod the hardware into having something we can call a "game".
Along the way, we will make plenty of mistakes, so we can learn how to debug our code.

And finally, Part III is about "advanced" use of the hardware, where we learn how to make even better-looking games, and we program a Shoot 'Em Up!

Unfortunately, this tutorial is a work in progress.
Currently, **Part I is being written**, and Parts II and III should follow soon after.
